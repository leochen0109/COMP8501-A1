This code demonstrates how to load a pretrained FCN-ResNet50 or FCN-ResNet101 model from PyTorch Vision for semantic segmentation, preprocess an image, and apply the model to generate segmentation predictions. It includes downloading an example image, preprocessing it to fit model requirements, and using the model to predict the image's semantic segments. Finally, it visualizes the segmentation results by assigning colors to different classes and displaying the color-coded segmentation map. By running the code you can get the output image.

Technique report:
The provided code elucidates the utilization of a sophisticated Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture, specifically leveraging the ResNet50 or ResNet101 models pre-trained on a diverse dataset, for the task of semantic segmentation. This operation entails the retrieval of a designated image from a remote repository, followed by a meticulous preprocessing regimen to adapt the image to the stringent input requirements of the neural network. Subsequent to preprocessing, the image undergoes inferential analysis by the model, which outputs a segmentation map categorizing each pixel into one of several classes. The culmination of this process is the generation of a visually interpretable representation, achieved by mapping each class to a unique color in the segmentation palette. This sophisticated procedure underscores the potential of deep learning methodologies in discerning and delineating distinct entities within pictorial data.
